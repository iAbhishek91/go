# Go

"Go is more about software engineering than programming language research" - Rob Pike

## Why Go

**Pain points**:

* Slow build
* uncontrolled dependencies
* each programmer using a different subset of language
* Poor program understanding (readibility, documentation)
* duplicate effort
* cost of updates
* version skew
* difficulties of writing automatic tools
* cross language builds

**With Go**:

* Take advantage of multicore, and very less was done by existing languages to take advantages of multicore effectively and safely. Go provide first class support to multi-core.
  * safe automatic memory management
  * garbage collection
  * other resource management
* efficient compilation, builds and execution
* Over complexity of other language like C++, Java, C#
  * deals with large code-bases. large dependencies, large team, clear syntax, clear semantics - Go makes it easy
  * like C, so that its not much radical, so that engineers can easily become productive.
  * code formatting
  * take advantages of modern tooling
* also portable :P

## Dates

* Dual core or multi-core: 2005 ish
* Go planning, and work started: 2006
* Go became open source: 2009
* Go V1 released: 2012

## Master-minds

* Robert Griesemer : Unix, father of UTF -8
* Rob Pike: creator of Pascal
* Ken Thompson: father of Unix, father of B, contributed heavily on C and UTF-8

## Go outstand at

* system programming
* web services at scale
* networking: http, tcp/udp
* load-balancing
* concurrency /parallelism
* automation and CLI tools
* cryptography
* image processing
* mobile applications
* MI
