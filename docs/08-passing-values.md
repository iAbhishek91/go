# Passing values

* Almost in every programming language there is a two type of passing data. Namely **Pass by value**, **Pass by reference**
* In go variable are always pass by value. In pass by value copy of the data are passed, hence the any modification do not impact the original data.
* In go if one need to pass data by reference, use pointer.
* pointer are light weight and can pass reference of huge data structures (like array of size mb) to another function.
